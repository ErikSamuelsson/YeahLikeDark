YeahLikeDark
============

A dark theme for Sublime Text 3. Inspiration taken from the dark theme Solarized but because I didn't find in optimal I made a new one.

## Installation

### Mac OS X
Put the tmTheme file in *~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User-Themes* and activate it in Sublime Text by choosing *Preferences -> Color Scheme -> User-Themes -> YeahLikeDark*
